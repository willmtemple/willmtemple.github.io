PeerReviewWeb is a platform that supports the integration of Peer Reviews into
coursework. During or after submitting work for an assignment in a course,
students will review and comment on each others' work.

It supports multiple courses, configurable instruction staff and student
rosters, multiple assignments and multi-stage assignments, with configurable
assignment group settings, and configurable review parameters including dynamic
review forms.

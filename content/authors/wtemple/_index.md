I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I work on the [Azure SDK for
JavaScript][azsdk]. I focus on developer experience, designing and implementing
idiomatic and intuitive APIs for REST services in TypeScript. Before Microsoft,
I was a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, where I studied
Computer Science Education. I'm a Linux enthusiast, and I enjoy working and
playing with Linux containers and related technology such as
Kubernetes/OpenShift.

I'm building a hobbyist programming language (who isn't these days?).  The goal
of [Serendipity][serendipity] is to identify elemental constructions in
computing and to design a language with an elegant and expressive syntax and
type system to teach those structures. You can find any writing about that
project, my other projects, and of course any rants on [the blog](#posts).
